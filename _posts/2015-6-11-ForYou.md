##SONG FOR YOU MISS/MADAM


**Hey girl, this song aptly suits us well, so as you sung "Tu mera Humdard hai...." (I never knew you could fake your feelings so much, I was awe in the feelings you had in the song for me), I found this song recently, and  yes after listening to it, I was in love with it, beacuse it aptly suits us..... I know you wont be reading this blog, but if you do, please have a look....**

<br><br><br><br>
I miss the taste of a sweeter life, <br>
 I miss the conversation, <br>
 I'm searching for a song tonight, <br>
 I'm changing all of the stations, <br>
 I like to think that we had it all, <br>
 We drew a map to a better place, <br>
 But on that road I took a fall, <br>
 Oh baby why did you run away? <br>
<br><br>
I was there for you,<br>
 In your darkest times, <br>
 I was there for you<br>
 In your darkest nights<br>
<br><br>
But I wonder where were you<br>
 When I was at my worst<br>
 Down on my knees<br>
 And you said you had my back<br>
 So I wonder where were you<br>
 All the roads you took came back to me<br>
 So I'm following the map that leads to you<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Ain't nothing I can do<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Following, following, following to you<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Ain't nothing I can do<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Following, following, following<br>
<br><br>
I hear your voice in my sleep at night<br>
 Hard to resist temptation<br>
 'Cause all these strangers come over me<br>
 Now I can't get over you<br>
 No I just can't get over you<br>
<br><br>
I was there for you<br>
 In your darkest times<br>
 I was there for you<br>
 In your darkest nights<br>
<br><br>
But I wonder where were you<br>
 When I was at my worst<br>
 Down on my knees<br>
 And you said you had my back<br>
 So I wonder where were you<br>
 All the roads you took came back to me<br>
 So I'm following the map that leads to you<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Ain't nothing I can do<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Following, following, following to you<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Ain't nothing I can do<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
<br><br>
Oh oh oh<br>
 Oh oh oh<br>
 Yeah yeah yeah<br>
 Oh oh<br>
<br><br>
Oh I was there for you<br>
 Oh in your darkest times<br>
 Oh I was there for you<br>
 Oh in your darkest nights<br>
<br><br>
Oh I was there for you<br>
 Oh in you darkest times<br>
 Oh I was there for you<br>
 Oh in your darkest nights<br>
<br><br>
But I wonder where were you<br>
 When I was at my worst<br>
 Down on my knees<br>
 And you said you had my back<br>
 So I wonder where were you<br>
 All the roads you took came back to me<br>
 So I'm following the map that leads to you<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Ain't nothing I can do<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Following, following, following to you<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Ain't nothing I can do<br>
 The map that leads to you<br>
 Following, following, following<br>
<br><br><br>
