## REALISATION...Dont know if it is true?
<br><br>

Started writing this after a lot of thinking. I dont think she loves me anymore, or I dont know what she is trying to prove me by this. But really, it did hurt alot. I never expected this. She always denied me about that guy, I dont know but my intuition always said that it was him. I tried my best to give to her, tried my best to make her happy, keep her happy. I dont know where I went faulty, but really I miss her, I would wait for her forever, I know.
I know she would never return back. That is the sole reason she is doing this, to make sure that she doesnot have to return back. But, where was I wrong? I always wanted to be with her, all the time, both of our streams were different, but I tried to sacrifice my dreams to be with her. I know she has forgot me, but I will always remember those beautiful eyes, those eyes which drove me crazy, those watery eyes making me promise her not to leave me, ever. I had planned my whole life with you, Girl!
I dont know why you did this, maybe I was not acting as your best freind, I was acting like your dad, but I never wanted you to sacrific your dreams, that is what I all wanted, I saw you were deviating, so I scolded you to study, life was far better without whatsapp/facebook, I wanted to ensure that you pass through by flyng colors, same you did in your medical entrance exams. And what I got to hear? <br>
"I am the reason to ruin her life, and I would certainly ruin her and force her to leave her career!"
<br>
Still I love you, what am I? A dOG?
<br>
*I know you forgot me, but if you do remember me, please come back, I will wait!*
